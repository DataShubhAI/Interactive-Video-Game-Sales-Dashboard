#  Interactive Video Game Sales Dashboard 

This project is an interactive dashboard built with Tableau that visualizes video game sales data. It allows users to dynamically analyze sales trends based on various filters like region, year, and genre. This project is based on a YouTube tutorial.

##  Features

* ** Dynamic Regional Sales Analysis:** A single chart to view sales data for North America, Europe, Japan, Global, and Other regions.
* ** Customizable Date Range:** Interactive sliders to filter sales data by a specific range of years.
* ** Top 10 Charts:** View the top 10 video games, platforms, and publishers based on your selected filters.
* ** Genre-wise Sales Breakdown:** A bar chart to compare sales across different game genres.
* ** Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** At-a-glance view of total counts for games, platforms, publishers, and genres.
* ** Interactive Dashboard:** All charts and KPIs are integrated into a single, user-friendly dashboard for a comprehensive analysis.

##  Technology Used

* **Tableau:** The primary tool used for creating the interactive dashboard.
* **CSV:** The data is imported from a CSV file.

##  Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* **Tableau Desktop:** You'll need to have Tableau Desktop installed on your computer. You can download it from the [official Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download).

### Installation

1.  **Get the Data:** The video game sales data is available as a CSV file. You can find the link to download it in the description of the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWWLMb1Dcy4).
2.  **Clone the Repo (Optional):** If you want to keep the Tableau file and the data in a local Git repository, you can clone this repo:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username_/project_name.git](https://github.com/your_username_/project_name.git)
    ```
3.  **Open the Tableau File:**
    * If you have the `.twbx` (Tableau Packaged Workbook) file, simply open it in Tableau Desktop.
    * If you are starting from scratch, open Tableau, connect to the downloaded CSV file, and follow the steps in the [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWWLMb1Dcy4) to build the dashboard.

##  Usage

Once you have the dashboard open in Tableau, you can interact with it using the filters and parameters on the right-hand side of the screen.

* **Select a Sales Region:** Use the "Zone Sales" dropdown to switch between different sales regions.
* **Adjust the Year Range:** Use the "Start Date" and "End Date" sliders to focus on a specific time period.

All the charts and KPIs on the dashboard will update dynamically based on your selections.
