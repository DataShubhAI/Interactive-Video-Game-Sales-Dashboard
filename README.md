#  Interactive Video Game Sales Dashboard 

This project is an interactive dashboard built with Tableau that visualizes video game sales data. It allows users to dynamically analyze sales trends based on various filters like region, year, and genre. This project is based on a YouTube tutorial.

* **Customizable Date Range:** Interactive sliders to filter sales data by a specific range of years.
* ** Top 10 Charts:** View the top 10 video games, platforms, and publishers based on your selected filters.
* ** Genre-wise Sales Breakdown:** A bar chart to compare sales across different game genres.
* ** Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** At-a-glance view of total counts for games, platforms, publishers, and genres.
* ** Interactive Dashboard:** All charts and KPIs are integrated into a single, user-friendly dashboard for a comprehensive analysis.
